## Initial support (arch definition, basic DTS, UART)
The current patcheset is at V4 and can be seen on [patchwork](https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/11607257/). With those patches you can boot your [Breadbee](https://github.com/breadbee/breadbee/) or [70mai Dash Cam](boards/dashcamlite.md) boards with the serial console and initramfs. Not much more is working at this stage, though, not even a reset.
