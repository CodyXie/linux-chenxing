# PM51

Depending on the chip there seems to be one or more 8051 cores embedded.
The main one seems to be pm51 (power management?) but there are references to hk51 (house keeping?) which might be the same thing.
There then seems to sometimes also be an 8051 that is responsible for handling part of the video input pipeline.

For now let's worry about pm51.

pm51 seem to be able to access:
- miu: to access the main system memory
- riu: to access peripheral registers. Some of the code suggests that pm51 can access the pm domain peripherals by
  default but needs register configuration to enable accessing registers in the "die domain".
- spi flash: seems to have access to memory mapped spi nor.. not sure where in the flash.
  The infinity3 docs have an empty section at the start of the flash presumably this is for the pm51
- maybe 64KB of it's own SRAM that is not accessible to the ARM cpu. It seems like BDMA has to be used to transfer
  data into it. Some of the BDMA headers have "1ksram" however. So it could be either.
