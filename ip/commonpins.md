## PM_RESET

This is the global reset.
This is active *high*. The reference circuit for this shows a 10uF capacitor and 10K resistor connected in series with PM_RESET connected at their connecting point.
The capacitor is tied to 3.3v and the resistor to ground. So the capacitor should start charged at 3.3v and get discharged via the resistor.
